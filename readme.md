This is a system where the information is stored online, in JSON formats in .json files. The files will be created with PHP if they dont exist. The system holds the views of users on a certain topic managed by an admin.
-----
The tables are not related as in a relational database. However, the information can be related using indexes in the array. In any case an element in array is deleted, then the indexes are rearranged, then the unique user IDs (which are auto incremented) are used.

We will be using the local server environment for the PHP code. the url should be http://localhost/noDb
